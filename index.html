    <font face = "courier">Nov 16, 19 - </font>The audio-focus-enforcement flag in ChromeOS has finally been removed, and I couldn't figure out how to turn this feature off. So, if a person plays an audio, and then another sound comes into play (e.g. a notification sound or a bell sound), the volume of the playing audio would be lowered for a few seconds before it's back to normal. Such a way to enjoy music! ChromeOS machines were enjoyable to use.</a>

    <font face = "courier">May 31, 19 - </font>The other day, I implemented the sequence alignment algorithm as a part of a homework assignment. Being a bit lazy, I implemented the na√Øve algorithm, which required the allocation of 10^8 integers, and I thought it would be fine as that was roughly 400MB of integers. However, the program was terminated due to lack of memory even though the machine had more than 2GB of free memory. As it turned out, the size of an integer in Python is 24 bytes. Interestingly, I would not had known this fact if I hadn't been lazy, or if I had bothered to use a slightly better machine.</a>
